I feel like it was just yesterday, when my mom woke me up 3 times every morning. Because I was too weak to wake up. I’m a late sleeper since I was a kid.

I feel like it was just yesterday, when I ignored food that mom prepared for my breakfast. Have a breakfast usually makes my stomach sick and feel more sleepy at school.

I feel like it was just yesterday, when I told my mom, I will live with my relative because they have a computer that I can use, while we can not affoard yet to buy one at home.

I feel like it was just yesterday, when I told my mom I will have an extraculicular and or having a date with my girlfriend.

I feel like it was just yesterday, when I told you that I will make you happy.

Today..

I’m afraid, mom.

Afraid to forget about things that will make you happy.

Afraid if I’m too busy to find my own happines and forget to asking you “Are you happy?”
