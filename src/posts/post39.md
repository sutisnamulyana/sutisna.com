Someone told me that the first 5 years of running business is the hardest part. I do feel like it was challenging time to start business without any proper business background and proper working capital. The only thing I know was to playing with the code, at least.

I have been through a lot of up and down. And it was mostly struggle financially as this is the only job I do full time. My life, my family is depends on it.

The 5 years milestone is a very important remarks for the next big things I want to achieve in life.

## Out of the cage, again ##
The first five years of my career started outside my home town, which I’m grateful for that. It was gave me a bunch of experiences, networks that shape me as an entrepreneur as I’m today.

As I live and work far my home, I was always want to do something matters for my home town. I have accomplish this on the last five years of building Sawala. And I think it is the time for me to go out of the cage, again.

Before going out again, I have to make sure that my ‘cage’ is still safe and sound without my intensive involvement on everyday business operational. I want Sawala, to go beyond Sutisna-oriented company without sacraficing qualities, values and culture I hope to always see in the company.

## The new comfort ##
My comfort zone is now being able to spend as much time as I can at home and home town, doing this Sawala things. But, I need to find my new comfort.

For the next five years, I want to take my master degree on business (MBA) and my master degree on ICT. Hopefully one of it is outside Indonesia. And want to work at multi-national company that combine my background fusion of technology and business.
