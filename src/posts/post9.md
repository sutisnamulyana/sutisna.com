People change over time. We might never be the same person as we are today.

People priority change over time. Things that important to us today, might be something we keep asking ourself “Why I did those things?”.

People trust, change over time. We might trust to somebody today, and weeks later we realize we can no longer relay on to their commitment.

People and changes. It’s a long lasting partner.

But..

I choose to not let people define who I am, just because they change.

I choose to not let people distracting me to achieve my dreams, just because they change.

I choose to keep believe to myself. Even if, they change to not believing me.

Eaaaah😂
