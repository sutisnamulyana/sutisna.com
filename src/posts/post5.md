I previously written down a new year resolution with a very long list. For 2018, I will only focus on my priorities. My wishes are a 10x better of..

## Revenue stream & business model ##

Iâ€™ve been running my business for 2 years now. Since we are bootstraping Leap Up and depends on tailor made projects to generate profit, some times in a year we were very struggle financialy. This year, I need to focus to implement new business models and alternative income sources. Like try to release several products (SaaS) we already planned for at least a year. It will be challanging, but worth to try!

## Financial tracking ##

Itâ€™s again about financial. For 2 years, I handle the financial administration by myself. So that, I sometimes forgot to tracking well. This year, I need to start hire someone to at least tracking both my company and personal financial. I do believe, financialy better will start with how we tracking our expenses and income. So thereâ€™ll be no reason to not evaluate where the money went and to saving more.

## Deep work, short working hours, engaged relationship ##

I already try to go to my office at 10am at last, and come back home at about 5pm. I know itâ€™s more challanging to manage new business like this, but I have another priority to complete, like have a time for me to spend time with my family and spend time to invest in myself (for learning/reading).

## Finish my bachelor degree ##

My academic journey is a roller coster way. I was completed the diploma for almost 4 years and currently continue the bachelor degree for 1 year. Hopeful can manage time better so that I can complete it this year.

## English test ##

I never take the proper english test like TOEFL/IELTS. I need to start to preparing for the test. I need to be ready to continue my academic journey.

__PS: No! I donâ€™t really need a fancy car this year. May be next year(s) ? ðŸ˜€__
