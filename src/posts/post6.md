I was starting really dive deep into entrepreneurship and startup world since my second job 4 years ago. And it always exciting to meet amazing founders and products.

Some of them have a brilliant ideas. They may comes up with those ideas based on their personal experiences and or based on research. It may seem easy to have brilliant ideas, but I do believe those brilliant ideas takes time and those possibly not their first idea. Maybe it after 100+ so so ideas.

Each of us will have a brilliant ideas for whatever we want to achieve on our own timezone.

I will not just wait for those. I have to start working with so so ideas and execute it well.
