title: 40 countries before 40
date: 2022-07-16

I have a new goal. It is to visit and explore 40 countries before 40 years old. This new goal is achievable, especially because I will relocate to Sweden in Q4 of this year. Relocating to Sweden will give an advantage to reaching Europe countries (and some countries outside) easier than if depart from Indonesia.

Of course, I will bring my little family along for this goal (some countries may be safer for me to do without them). Because they also will join me on my relocation to Europe.

This goal should cover 6 world’s continents:
- Asia
- Africa
- North America
- South America
- Europe
- Australia and New Zealand



### Current Progress ###
As per Q3 2022, I have visited:

__Asia__
- Malaysia
- Singapore
- Philippines
- India
- Hongkong

__North America__
- United States of America (USA)
- Europe
- Sweden (I will be there soon)

So in total, I have visited
- 3 continents
- 7 countries
- I will not count my home country for sure.


 ### Target ###
According to my current progress, I have to complete to explore these by 2033:

- 3 continents (Africa, Australia/New Zealand and South America left)
- 33 countries

I need to visit and explore at least 3-4 countries per year to be able to reach the goal on time. I’m confident can do more per year.

__Breakdown__

The journey will start as soon as possible on Q1/Q2 2023. I will probably start with Scandinavian countries first. Then continue to the nearest countries from Sweden.

For countries that are quite far from Sweden, I would need to use my 30 days of holiday per year that I might take every Summer.

The first phase is definitely Europe countries. This is my country list.

__Northern Europe (3)__
- Norway
- Denmark
- Finland

__Western Europe (7)__
- UK
- Netherland
- Belgium
- Germany
- France
- Switzerland
- Austria

- Italy
- Spain
- Greece

__Eastern Europe (6)__
- Estonia
- Poland
- Romania
- Hungary
- Bulgaria
- Russia

__North America (3)__

__South America (4)__
- Brazil
- Colombia

- Peru

__Southern Asia (3)__

__Western Asia (10)__
